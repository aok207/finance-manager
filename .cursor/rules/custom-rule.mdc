Always use shadcn ui components

Always follow the folder structure and pattern already used in the project.

Never create index files just to export things.

Never use React.FC to declare the types of the Props

Never do beyond what is asked like creating demo pages and modifying readmes.

# Project Tech Requirements

Before implementing code, read through these to make sure you follow our coding guide.

## NPM Requirements

when trying to install packages, always use pnpm. I do not use bun or yarn.

## Component System

We are using ShadCN for our component library, always check if there is an existing shadcn component first and try to install one before trying to implement you own.

## Form Library

We are using react-hook-form with client side validation using zod. Make sure all forms have some type of client side validation

## Loader Buttons

All buttons should show a loader spinner inside them while the form is being submitted

## Data Fetching

We should always use useQuery and useMutation when trying to fetch or store data.

# Design

All pages should work with light mode and dark mode in mind. Never hard code any colors without also providing the light / dark mode equivalent. Always use the variables for the colors.
